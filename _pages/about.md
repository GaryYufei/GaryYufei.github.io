I am currently a PhD student from Macquire University, working on vision-and-language tasks, such as [Image Captioning](https://github.com/zhjohnchan/awesome-image-captioning) and Novel Object Captioning [ICCV'19](/publication/nocaps_iccv19). I also have experience in working on semantic role labelling and constituency and dependency parsing [ACL'19](/publication/synSRL_acl19). I am suerpvised by [Prof. Mark Johnson](http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~mjohnson/).
