I am currently a PhD student from Macquire University, working on vision-and-language tasks, such as [Image Captioning](https://github.com/zhjohnchan/awesome-image-captioning) and Novel Object Captioning. I am suerpvised by [Prof. Mark Johnson](http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~mjohnson/).

I have experience in working on semantic role labelling and constituency and dependency parsing.
